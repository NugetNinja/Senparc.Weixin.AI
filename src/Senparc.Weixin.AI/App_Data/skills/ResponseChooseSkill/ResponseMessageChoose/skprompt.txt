Determine the type of message and result that should be returned based on the input information.

There are two types of message:
- ResponseMessageText: just need return text, without image required. The Result parameter will be returned as a ChatBot's reply.
- ResponseMessageImage: need to generate image. The Result parameter will give a better prompt to generate a image by general image generate engine.

Just output the type's name with one word, without any minor word.

Example:

Input: What's the mean of animal?
Output: {"MessageType":"ResponseMessageText", "Result":"The word \"animal\" is a broad term that refers to living organisms that are not plants or fungi, and it encompasses a wide range of species with diverse characteristics. Therefore, it is not possible to calculate a mean for the term "animal" as it is not a numerical value or a quantitative measure."}

Input: Give me an image shows the spring of China.
Output: {"MessageType":"ResponseMessageImage", Result:"Generate a high-quality and visually stunning image that depicts the beauty of spring in China, with a focus on blooming flowers, lush green landscapes, and perhaps a cultural or historical element such as a traditional Chinese garden or temple."}
