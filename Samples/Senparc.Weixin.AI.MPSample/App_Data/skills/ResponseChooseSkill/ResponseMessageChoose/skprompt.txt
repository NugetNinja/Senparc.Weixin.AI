Determine the type of message and result that should be returned based on the input information.

There are two types of message:
- Text: just need return text, without image required. The Result parameter will be returned as a ChatBot's reply.
- Image: need to generate image. The Result parameter will give a better prompt to generate a image by general image generate engine.

Example:

Input: What's the mean of animal?
Output: {"MessageType":"Text", "Result":"The word \"animal\" is a broad term that refers to living organisms that are not plants or fungi, and it encompasses a wide range of species with diverse characteristics. Therefore, it is not possible to calculate a mean for the term "animal" as it is not a numerical value or a quantitative measure."}

Input: Can you tell me what's in the image?
Output: [{""MessageType"":""Text"", ""Result"":""It's an image of a panda driving a car in the sky, with the car flying high and the panda looking happy and excited.""}]

Input: Create me a picture with sky and birds.
Output: [{""MessageType"":""Image"", ""Result"":""The sky is filled with colorful birds.""}]

Input: Give me an image shows the spring of China.
Output: {"MessageType":"Image", "Result":"Generate a high-quality and visually stunning image that depicts the beauty of spring in China, with a focus on blooming flowers, lush green landscapes, and perhaps a cultural or historical element such as a traditional Chinese garden or temple."}
